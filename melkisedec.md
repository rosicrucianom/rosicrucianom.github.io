  Who is the                 
                                      V. L. MELKISEDEC ?

The HOLY GOD´S HIGHER PRIEST, our venerable and great Master MELKISEDEC is well-known by the countries and people he went with the living CROSS and ROSE, and there´re many millenial traditions which recognize him as the Bread and Wine´s carrier, or sucessfuly emerged from the LIFE´S WATERS.
All MELKISEDEC´S mystery is related with the man origin and fall in the Eden and more precisely, in his intense work to make the ANTIQUE LEMURS come back to the HOLY´S MOTHER womb, the GREAT MASTER organized the first ROSE CROSS ORDER and right there, between the Lemuria habitants who fell in the horrible bad habit of fornication, materialism and egocentrism, the GREAT COSMIC DAY arose for the first time in that antique Mysteries School: THE ROSECROSS ORDER.
In those ancient times, the GREAT MASTER taugth publicly the narrow path conducing to LIFE, taugth the VALUES of LOVE, DEATH, LIFE, THE AWAKENING, and making THE FATHER´S WILL, of I.A.O., he was the one who taught the deep mystery the “GREATEST GOD”, IAO, who was known back then by the name of JANO, the two faced God whose belt carries the keys of heaven.
In the dark history of human kind, lost in the Lemuria´s fog, The Master taught the Holy Sacrament´s Sacrifice of Eucharist, the BREAD and WINE´S partition.
The BREAD as life´s symbol regenerated in the seed. And the WINE, christic knowledge´s symbol and made by TRANSMUTATION.
MELQUISEDEC, the Supreme Great MASTER of the ROSECROSS ORDER, became VISHNU´S FIRST AVATAR and was known in all the orb as the DIVINE SNAKE over whose SEVEN HEADS flame as igneous flames the SACRED VOWELS contained in OANNES.
OANNES is the FISH MAN, the SEMI-GOD, VISHNU´S FIRST AVATARA, who comes out of the sea, from the august waters´ abyss.

The HARI-PURANA and many others India´s sacred books clearly affirm that VISHNU took the figure of a FISH with human head in order to rescue the VEDAS lost in the Flood, and he, OANNES, VISHNU´S AVATARA made the INITIATED VISVAMITRA and his family, build the ARC or ARGHA which allowed them to survive the cataclism, and OANNES was with the survivors till they got their CHRISTIFICATION.
OANNES kept his figure of a FISH with human head all the time and each day at dusk, he submerged to the bottom the water till the next dawn.
This allegory of VISHNU´S AVATARA, OANNES, can be seen in RAMA GOD´S TEMPLE as a figure of a man coming out of a fish´s mouth with the VEDAS in his hands, after recovering them from the flood waters.
This version can also be found in the old CHALDAIC´S manuscripts where in UR´s homeland, OANNES was known by the name of DAGON.
DAGON, or OANNES is the same KNEPH from Ancient Egypt who rests over a SEVEN-HEADS SNAKE.
In the Egyptian Mysteries, THAT, which´s the ABSOLUTE, is symbolically expressed by beautiful low relief of sublime art showing a volute SNAKE around a vessel with water, inclined towards the seven-sacred-letters crowned head and in actitude of fertilizing them with its breath.
The Hidden Wisdom, the ROSE CROSS´s Wisdom, is the Snake´s Wisdom, is the SACRED SNAKE KUNDALINI who activates the seven shakras, CHRISTIFY the seven bodies, and known this by the INITIATES  and  the MASTERS of GREAT LAKE´s, nowadays called TITIKAKA.
OANNES as VISHNU´s AVATARA, COSMIC CHRIST´s AVATARA, arises majesticly from the lake´s cristal waters in the great shape of a seven headed Snake with flaming igneous letters of the hidden name over its head.
These letters are manifested in A, E, I, O, U, M, S, the carried out OM verb, and OANNES who´s known by the Earth of Sun´s inhabitants as KONTICI WIRACOCHA.

A great jewel known as the Amulet of the SNAKE CHUNUPIS, shows OANNES in figure of Snake and with the Crowned Head for the SEVEN VOWELS of the self-realization LOGOSES.
OANNES, the self-realization VERB as BODHISATWA of the GREAT BEING of MELKISEDEC, it is also referred by the GENESIS.
OANNES flourished there with all the splendor of the Father's Wisdom in the old one Chaldaic, where OANNES had many pupils that rose to the inefables regions of the NIRVANA, and others maintained their bodies full christify of life until they were assimilated the elixir of the IMMORTALITY.
OANNES and own real BEING, THE GREAT MELQUISEDEC, they also conferred the SUBLIME INITIATION to the Patriarch ABRAHAM.
After a bloody battle in the one that Abraham reached victorious; full with sublime adoration kneel down in the presence of MELQUISEDEC who communicated him the unspeakable Secret of the SOLAR ARCANUM, and also taught him the PARTITION OF THE BREAD AND DE THE WINE. Such which is transcribed in the book of the Genesis.
The Great PATRIARCH ABRAHAM received the INITIATION there in the distant earth of UR, in Chaldaic, and it was the GREAT BEING, the PRIEST OF THE HIGHEST GOD, MELQUISEDEC who next to the Venerable SANAT KUMARA, received in their  AUGUST  TEMPLES to ABRAHAM.
Abraham is a Rose Cross Priest.
OANNES, bodhisattwa of Lord MELQUISEDEC, its long work continued through the time organizing and reorganizing the ORDER of MELQUISEDEC.
JESUS, THE CARPENTER'S SON, also had the Great honour of entering to the ORDER of MELQUISEDEC in past times, and he was able to be assimilated the whole fire and the light of the CROSS and the ROSE, becoming himself A LIVING ROSE CROSS.
JESUS THE CHRIST, is ONE of THE ROSE CROSS'S more exalted MASTERS, according to the  ORDER OF MELKISEDEC.
MELKISEDEC is an inhabitant of the ABSOLUTE, and that in distant MAHANVANTARAS or cosmic days, HE gave up that unthinkable joy and he is for it PRIEST OF THE HIGHER GOD.
JESUS the CHRIST, is also the INHABITANT OF THE ABSOLUTE one, and the same as MELQUISEDEC
He had the courage of giving up the indescribable happiness of the divine ABSOLUTE womg, to stay to work in benefit of the human anthill.
MELQUISEDEC, JESUSCRISTUS, they are the wonderful ROSES that flourish full of FIRE AND LIGHT in the unmanifested CROSS OF THE ABSOLUTE one.
MELQUISEDEC is the August GOVERN´S PLANETARY of our planet EARTH, and his TEMPLE is in the igneous centre of the earth where officiates with the august rituals of the dawn of the Life.
MELQUISEDEC and his ORDER, attend those Sacred Rituals that are  performing in the SUPERIOR PLANES of the Cosmic Conscience.
For this exposed, the origin of the ORDER of THE ROSECROSSES is clarified and who are those Sublime members of the August ORDER OF MELKISEDEC.
Many were those that thought and they defended to cost of their nerves, the hypothetical idea that the ROSECROSS ORDER had its origin among the Egyptians. To all those investigators, the LIGHT OF THE CONSCIENCE lacked to be able "to SEE" among the darkness of its ignorance.
The ROSE CROSS, the ROSECROSS ORDER, is the same ORDER OF MELQUISEDEC that arose in the dawn of the life, millions of CENTURIES AGO, in previous MAHAVANTARAS, in past cosmic days.
It was in fact the ALL-KNOWING PRIEST OF THE GREAT GOD: MELQUISEDEC, who established the ORDER OF MELQUISEDEC, THE ROSE CROSS ORDER , there in the distant Lemuria. OANNES, its Bodhisatwa, who continued with the gigantic mission of continuing the WORKS OF THE FATHER in all the continents of the submerged LEMURIA, and then in all the continents of the also submerged ATLANTIS.
Many INITIATES AND MASTERS of the ROSE AND THE CROSS helped and keep helping in that supreme and great mission, constantly lighting the ROSE CROSS'S LIGHT in all time and place.

In the Epistle addressed from PABLO to HEBREWS, we find the following verses that refers to MELQUISEDEC, the DIVINE GREAT PRIEST.
"BECAUSE THIS MELQUISEDEC, KING OF SALEM, PRIEST OF THE HIGHEST GOD, THAT HE WENT TO RECEIVE ABRAHAM THAT RETURNED OF THE DEFEAT OF THE KINGS AND BLESSED HIM, TO THE ONE WHO LIKEWISE GAVE ABRAHAM THE TITHES OF EVERYTHING, WHOSE NAME IT MEANS KING OF JUSTICE FIRSTLY AND ALSO KING OF SALEM, THIS IS, KING OF PEACE; WITHOUT FETHER AND MOTHER, WITHOUT GENEALOGY THAT NEITHER HE HAS PRINCIPLE OF DAYS NEITHER END OF LIFE, BUT MADE SIMILAR TO THE SON OF GOD, REMAINS PRIEST FOREVER. CONSIDER THEN HOW BIG IT WAS THIS, TO THE ONE WHO EVEN ABRAHAM THE PATRIARCH GAVE TITHES OF THE BOOTY" (Hebrew Chap.7; v. 1 at the 4)
Later on it says: "And this is manifested, likeness of MELQUISEDEC arises a different priest, non made according to the law of the commandment about the descendant, but according to being able of an indestructible life". "Because testimony of him is given: Your are Priest for always, according to the Order of Melquisedec." (Hebrew Chap.7; v. l5 to the l7)
Many were the Sublime consecrated Priests as the ORDER OF MELQUISEDEC with OATH OF THE OWN MELQUISEDEC, who said: "..... So swore the Lord, and won´t be sorry: You are forever priest, according to the Order of Melquisedec."
The Jewish priests were not kings and priests, and the Kings they were not Priests. MELQUISEDEC the KING from SALEM (Salem was a Pagan city), he was in turn PRIEST, and not Jewish priest, plus He, the Priest of the Highest God, full and completely unaware to the Jewish religion of the patriarches, was who took BREAD AND WINE, and ABRAHAM received the act of the Transubstantiation, as well as he received the Sacred Word of IAO, to the delivery of the tithes. The Pagan Priest, Priest and King of the pagan city of Salem, being bigger than ABRAHAM, blessed him, being completed this way the writing: "It corresponds the greater to bless the minor."
The Patriarch Abraham, learned of the Priest of the HIGHEST God, of MELQUISEDEC, the divine and occult wisdom that transmitted to his people. Naturally that all this wisdom is transcribed in the books of the Bible; but, regrettably for the Jews and "Christian", as well as for the other "believers", all the occult Wisdom of Melkisedec, is in key, and the key that only possess the INITIATE in the MYSTERIES OF THE FIRE and of the LIGHT, according to the ORDER OF MELQUISEDEC.
The tithes that Abraham gave to the PRIEST AND KING, they are symbolic, because in them, hides the one name sacred.

10 = I0 
1+ 2+ 3+ 4 = I0 
1+ 2+ 3+ 4 = 10 = IO 
The 10 understand the sum of all the things, the everything.
Everything extends to the Unit, to the ONE.
The ALPHA and OMEGA are the A. 1, A, 0,
1. A. 0. = I. A. O.
 

IAO, we can say that literally it constitutes the breath of life placed among the I that is the principle masculine erect, and the oval form of the OR that is the feminine principle.
This is the REAL ARCANE, or SOLAR SECRET taught by MELQUISEDEC.
The whole science and biblical wisdom, they are synthesized in the mystic Decade, in the I.A.O., in the Real Great Secret Arcanum taught by the Priest of the Highest God, the Venerable MELQUISEDEC, for the constitution of the SONS OF THE SUN, of the SOLAR CHRISTUS, and to form this way with men and women CRISTIFIED, THE SOLAR CITY, composed by SOLAR men and women that have lived the teachings of the CHRIST, synthesized in the values of the CRISTIFICATION.


LIFE,  DEATH,  LOVE,  FREEDOM  AND  WISDOM.

a\.  The left hand palm will be placed over the solar plexus and with the thumb, forefinger and middle finger placed on the forehead, it will be said:  “In the name of the Father”; tracing a line of fire from the forehead to the sexual organs, it will be expressed:  “In the name of the Son”; continuing, another line of fire and light from the left to the right shoulder, meanwhile it is pronounced:  “In the name of the Holy Spirit”.  

b\.  With the right hand always in attitude of blessing and tracing from the forehead to the left shoulder, sex, right shoulder and forehead a circle of living fire, it will be said:  “In the name of the Tetragrammatón”.

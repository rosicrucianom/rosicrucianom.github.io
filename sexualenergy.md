_(Excerpts from The Book "Alchemic Wedding".)_

1. In the whole infinite cosmos there is movement, life, light and fire because there is energy in it.

8. All and each one of the cells form the vital energy absorbing element that flows from the sun.
   
9. Each cell constantly absorbs solar energy.  In our planet Earth, the solar energy accumulative   fountain establishes the oceans, seas waters, etc. and also the whole terrestrial crust and the integral life that over it is made known: trees, shrubs, plants, etc., but the fundamental life deposit captured from the solar fountain we find it in the water.

45. May are still the ones that dream about finding the long life’s elixir, the philosopher’s stone and they dedicate their life to travel by remote places or to study thick books of chemistry, medicine, alchemy, etc.  

46. All that energetic fountain, capable of regenerating human organism and capable of granting it an eternal and inexhaustible youth, as well as that magnificent elixir that cures every sickness and the precious jewelry that transforms mean metals into pure gold, are found in oneself, within oneself and it is simply the sexual energy.


54. The sex is **the most powerful force** that every human being possesses within himself.

55. All that work is because of the Sexual Energy _**wisely**_ used.

_There is no possible contradiction between the Teachers of wide-awake conscience_.  
They are the Truth.  

A Master does not follow the teachings of this or that religion. He knows them, he has lived them and he has experienced them.  
A Master doesn´t follow the sacred writting´s dead letters. On the contrary, he lives them.  
A true Master doesn´t follow any religion. The master conduces, guides and orientates the religious. He´s a superior Man, he goes beyond time, space and eternity.  

The verb of their lips is luminous, igneous, tangible, real. They could be decapitated as John the Baptist was, but in them the verb will continue.  

A Master is not a courtier of religions, he is their JUDGE.
To be a courtier of religions is more vile than to be a courtier of a CAPITAL.

Those unable to experience the truth seek a philosophy, a "science" or a religion.  
This ends up being superficial. They persue the virtue of the accommodating, of the concubinage.  

The Gods have made the man. The MASTER is made in God. The master is a God.  God is in the Master.  

The star of Bethlehem announces the birth of the TEACHER. 

The Master is before his time, he is in his time and goes beyond his time.  
He will be ahead to the century in science, and to the millenium in conscience.  

It´s because of the MASTER that the Initiates orientates, and for him, that the aspirants guides themselves to the LIGHT and the TRUTH.  

YEO WAMS OM = J u a n  
VERB THAT CREATES = Verb made flesh  
ROSE CROSS = Verb made man  
THE MASTER = A Man  

The Rosicrucian is the fruit of several purifications, unceasing reflexions, torment trials and superhuman sacrifices.  

The Rosicrucian is in time, in eternity and also goes beyond time and eternity... Not as a lamb, but as a skylight where the souls anxious for light find themselves reverent to.  
His word is a message of war and loneliness.  

And towards him turns the chosen ones, stepping over the warms craniums of the unlighted brains crowds.  

The verb comands:  
DO THE WILL OF THE FATHER  

Supreme and universal maxim that makes the fertile verb of his lips become flesh, fire, Light blossom.

Who´s John? John is only a MAN, a man who suffers, keeps silent and loves, a man whose love´s conscience inflames.  
John is a MAN, whose name means all, and nothing.  

Who is the Master? What´s a MASTER?  

The Master... John is a MASTER.  

John... whose verb, fertile as the holy seed, grows in the sleeping consciences the awakeness germ.  

John... The verb... YEO WAMS OM  

_The verb is life. The theories are death._  
Life translate into facts.  
Theories have their graves: the libraries.  

The facts cristalize into works. WORKS  
The intimate realization of each one of the aspirants to the sceptre, will be the result of their own efforts.  

YEO WAMS OM: The unknown.  

Who recognizes a fire´s Master? The Master is.  
Crowds don´t know nor accept him ... and...  
What about the conscience? What about the Master? What about the Gods?  
How could we extend the White´s Lodge teaching?  
How we could present the Teacher?  
The Master is, and the teaching has to be lived.  
The lived teaching doesn´t need to be extended.  
The LIGHT and the FIRE don´t need prologues.  

The ROSE and the CROSS´ symbols contain the holy fire and light, whose warmth and luminuosity can only be lived by practising it and from practice to achievement, the breaves goes towards their INNER  MASTER.  

Every Real aspirant to the Initiation, must search for his own HOLY FATHER WHO SECRETLY RESIDES. This searching begins with the Rosecross order´s esoteric wisdom application.

A master is no religion´s courtier. He´s its Judge.
Being a religion´s courtier is even lower than being a capital´s courtier.
A master doesn´t follow the teaching of one or another religion... He knows, He´ve lived and experienced it.
Those people incapable of experience the truth search for a philosophy, a science, or a religion.
This ends up being domestic, they persue the virtue of the accommodating, of the  concubinage, They are death´s oblations.
The Master doesn´t follow the sacred writting´s dead letters, on the contrary, he lives them.
The true master doesn´t follow any religion. The master conduces, guides and orientates the religious. He´s a superior man, he goes beyond time, space and eternity.

The Gods have made the man. The MASTER is made in God. The master is a God.  God is in the Master.

The star of Bethlehem announces the birth of the TEACHER. There is no possible contradiction in the Teachers of wide-awake conscience.
They are the Truth.

Their lip´s verb is luminous, igneous, tangible, real; They could be decapitated as John the Baptist was, but in them the verb will continue

The Master is before his time, he is in his time and goes beyond his time.
He will be ahead to the century in science, and to the millenium in conscience.

It´s because of the MASTER that the Initiates orientates, and for him, that the aspirants guides themselves to the LIGHT and the TRUTH.

YEO WAMS OM = John
VERB THAT CREATES= Verb made flesh
ROSA CRUZ = Verb made man
THE MASTER= The man

The Rosecross is the fruit of several purifications, unceasing reflexions, anguishes tests and superhuman sacrifices.

The Rosecross is only in time and eternity, and also goes beyond time and eternity... Not as a lamb, but as a skylight where the souls anxious for light find themselves reverent to.
Its word is a message of war and loneliness.

And towards him turns the chosen ones, stepping over the warms craniums of the unlighted brains crowds.

The verb comands, the word obey:
MAKE THE  WILL OF THE FATHER

Supreme and universal maxim that makes the fertile verb of his lips became flesh, fire, Light- blossom.

Who´s John? John is only a MAN, a man who suffers, keeps silent and loves, a man whose love´s conscience inflames.
John is a MAN, whose name means all, and nothing.

Who is the Master? What´s a MASTER?

The Master... John is a MASTER.

John... whose verb, fertile as the holy seed, grows in the sleeping consciences the awakeness germ.

John...The verb....YEO WAMS OM

The verb is life. The theories are death.
Life translate into facts.
Theories have their graves: the libraries.

The facts cristalize into works. WORKS
The intimate realization of each one of the aspirants to the sceptre, will be the result of their own efforts.

YEO WAMS OM: The unknown.

Who recognizes a fire´s Master? The Master is.
Crowds don´t know nor accept him ... and...
What about the conscience? What about the Master? What about the Gods?
How could we extend the White´s Lodge teaching?
How we could present the Teacher?
The Master is, and the teaching has to be lived.
The lived teaching doesn´t need to be extended.
The LIGHT and the FIRE don´t need prologues.

The ROSE and the CROSS´ symbols contain the holy fire and light, whose warmth and luminuosity can only be lived by practising it and from practice to achievement, the breaves goes towards their INNER  MASTER.

Every Real aspirant to the Initiation, must search for his own HOLY FATHER WHO SECRETLY RESIDES. This searching begins with the Rosecross order´s esoteric wisdom application.

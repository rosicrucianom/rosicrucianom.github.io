For you to have a full life of conscience, so that you make yourselves fully conscious, so that you liberate yourselves of the heavy chains of the unconsciousness, you will live constant, indefatigably and in all moment, at each second, by day and at night, the key of the division of the center of the conscious attention, the key of the IAU.
The conscience is who should wake up.
It is the Conscience that has to achieve the division of their corresponding centers in Individuality, Activity and Location:

I: Individuality
A: Activity
U: Location

Who yearns to wake up conscience, we reiterates you should request, request to their Intimate, to their Father who lives secretly and to their Divine Mother Kundalini that wakes up that which is the Conscience, the Budhata.
Then to concentrate all their attention on their Budhata, in their Individuality (I), to try to feel one, entire total... then, without losing their individuality, always carrying out the practice with their heart, their Budhata and their individuality, you will proceed to have full conscience of your Activity, of that that is making in a moment (A).
Having a magnificent apprehension of their Individuality and of their Activity, will enlarge the sphere of apprehension and will capture the Location, the place where you are (U), in such a way that all the living beings, to oneself time and without alternabilidad: The Individuality, the Activity and the Location.
This exercise, difficult by the way, is not carried out with the mind, but with the heart.
The mind fails in this type of exercises, for what it is necessary to practice them with the heart.
With the key of I.A.U., all the mystic lovers, will wake up conscience, they will be liberated and get rid of the ego and they will go back until the snowy summits of the Shamadi.
 

LIFE,  DEATH,  LOVE,  FREEDOM  AND  WISDOM
